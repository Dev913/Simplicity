8. Hidden Menu for setting an attacker based trap.
The hidden menu is the button called "Shutdown PC" why you may ask? Well it will redirect the attacker to another portion of Simplicity if they even get to Simplicity. But your login credidentials for "shutdown" is your username. Which you can obtain username by opening cmd and typing "whoami". The password is "-fR]8Q)py@ZyWC!P" without quotation marks. Then when you are finished setting up the requirements when the attacker presses "Delete all logged data" button it will take a picture of the attacker and send it to your email and crash your PC in order for it to be harder for the attacker to obtain access.
MAKE SURE TO ENABLE "less secure apps access" in gmail (only if you are utilizing gmail).
